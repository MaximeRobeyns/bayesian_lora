Django API
----------

On this page, we document how to setup the basic Django API and the workflow.

Project Initialisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure you have ``django`` installed::

    pip install -U django

Now, use the ``django-admin`` utility to create the project. From the root of
the project, run::

    django-admin startproject django_api

The main way to interact with the project will be by running commands exposed by
``django_api/manage.py``. For example::

    cd dango_api
    python manage.py runserver

You can see a full list of the available commands with::

    python manage.py --help

App Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Django project is structured into a number of independent apps. Many of the
standard functionality provided by Django is indeed provided as apps.

To create a new app, run::

    python manage.py startapp <appname>

App workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the basic workflow for creating a piece of functionality in an app.

Each endpoint in django is a "view". Now this is somewhat of a misnomer since
the response does not have to be some sort of rendered HTML (it could be some
JSON, CSV, a PDF file or anything else really). However, a *view* it is.

1. **Create Models**

2. **Create a view / handler function**

3. **Create a URL** Start by idenfiying at which URL path the function will be
   exposed. For this, create a ``<myapp>/urls.py`` file if you have not done so
   already, and enter something like the following


Admin Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up the admin panel, we need to create a user to login to the admin site::

    python manage.py createsuperuser
